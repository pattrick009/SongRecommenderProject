# SongRecommenderProject

With the advent of online services such as Pandora and iTunes, the music industry has shifted away from the traditional 
distribution model of selling physical copies of music to a cloud-based model that provides music for users to listen to. 
In this model, value is derived when these services present songs that the customer is interested in; either the customer 
purchases a subscription, or the customer pays for the song. In both cases, these music services can derive financial gain 
by improving their recommendations to potential customers of the songs they like. The recommendation system is useful in 
building the next probable playlist for users and suggestions based on their previous criteria. Amazon, Netflix and Spotify 
are great examples of such systems. A similar recommendation system based on user’s previous listen count of songs has been 
implemented through this model.  The project has been implemented and analyzed using the item based filtering recommendations. 
Music recommendation is a very difficult problem as we have to structure music in a way that we recommend favorite songs to 
users which is never a definite prediction. It is dynamic and influenced by factors other than user’s or song’s listening 
history. We have used the Million Songs Dataset a freely-available collection of audio features and metadata for a million 
contemporary popular music tracks to find the correlations between users and songs and to learn from the previous listening 
history of users to provide recommendations for songs which users would prefer to listen most.
